SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

**# Acceptance Criteria** GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
